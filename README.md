I used to have a beautiful neovim config, written from scratch, for 2 years.
We have gone through a lot together, from the discontinuation of packer
Unfortunetaly, on the halloween of 2024, the cpu on my laptop bricked, and the partition which contained that config was deleted.
So, now, I use lazyvim. Both because I didn't want to rewrite that config from scratch, and also because I trust that a group of dedicated neovim hackers will do a better job than me at optimizing lspconfig, lazyloading and all the bells and whistles that I don't have a lot of time to work on.

[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) config meant to achieve feature parity with my [vaate](https://github.com/Phillip-Etec/vaate) config, but with added features that would make it as useful as a full-blown IDE. **N**eo**v**im **a**s **a**n **i**ntegrated **d**evelopment **e**nvironment

Refer to the [lazyvim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to extend it.
